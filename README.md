This repo is currently not under active development due to conflicting responsibilities and lack of external interest (or any efforts to garner interest). \
If interested in discussing this project or other aspects of GPU programming, please open an issue and `@daltonrpruitt` to ping me (or find another way, I'm sure you're clever).
